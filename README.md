# Small TLV UDP Server

The repo has two implementations of UDP server: in Rust and Python.  
[Python implementation](https://github.com/zluuba/udp_tlv_server/blob/main/python/README.md) is about 80% complete.  
[Rust implementation](https://github.com/zluuba/udp_tlv_server/blob/main/rust/README.md) is roughly 50% complete and should be avoided for now, though it does work.
